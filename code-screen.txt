Code Screen (for DoSomething.org, from Barry Clark, 11-April-2014


Objective: Create a drupal module that converts the word "cat" into a hyperlink to an image of a cat.

Before: I wish I was a cat.

After: I wish I was a <a ...>cat</a>.


Features

The module should provide an input filter that can be attached to a text format

Cat images can be found using the google images API using this url (http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/images?v=1.0&q=kitten&rsz=8&safe=active)

There should be an admin settings page which allows an end user to specify what keywords should be converted.

Write a DrupalUnitTestCase against the keyword search logic
